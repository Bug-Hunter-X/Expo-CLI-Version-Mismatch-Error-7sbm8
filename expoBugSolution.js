// First, ensure you have the correct Node.js and npm versions.
// Then, Check your project's package.json or app.json to see what Expo CLI version is required.

// Use npm or yarn to install the specified Expo CLI version (or the latest compatible version).
npm install -g expo-cli@<required-version> // Replace <required-version> with the appropriate version

// Next, clear the Expo CLI cache:
expo start --clear

//Or, if the above doesn't work, try deleting the cache directory manually:
// (The location of the Expo cache directory can vary based on your operating system.)
// On macOS/Linux, it is usually located at ~/.expo
// On Windows, it is usually located at %LOCALAPPDATA%\Expo

//After clearing the cache, reinstall your project's dependencies using npm or yarn:
npm install

//Finally, try running the project again:
expo start

//If the problem persists, consider using expo upgrade to upgrade expo cli to the recommended version.
