This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the version of Expo CLI installed locally and the version required by your project.  The manifest file (usually `package.json` or `app.json`) might specify Expo CLI dependencies that aren't compatible with your current setup.  Another cause could be corrupted cache files from previous Expo CLI installations. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors during project initialization or build processes.
