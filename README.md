# Expo CLI Version Mismatch and Resolution

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: version mismatches that lead to unexpected errors and build failures. The `expoBug.js` file simulates a scenario where the project's dependencies conflict with the installed Expo CLI version. The `expoBugSolution.js` file showcases the steps to resolve this issue.

**Problem:** The Expo project might specify an Expo CLI version in its `package.json` or `app.json` that's incompatible with the version currently installed.  This can manifest in various ways, including build errors, unexpected behavior, or the CLI failing to initialize correctly.

**Solution:**  The solution usually involves:
1. Ensuring that the locally installed Expo CLI version is compatible with the project's requirements.
2. Clearing the Expo CLI cache to remove any potentially corrupted files.
3. Using `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and resolved.
4. Using `expo upgrade` to upgrade Expo CLI to the recommended version.
